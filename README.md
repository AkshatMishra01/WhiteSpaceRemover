# WhiteSpaceRemover
In the project ( https://github.com/users/Aman9026/projects/2 ), there's an issue with white spaces in between the file name.
This script would rename all the files in the system which has a __white space__ in it's name.
* _On testing the script it was observed that the files having huge names are __not fully corrected__, The script needs to run multiple times to correct all the files including the file with big names._
